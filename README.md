I'm a passionate 29-year-old programmer. I've wrote my first code at 11, my
[first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGsQe6-un3s) and
[second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuD5pWd3ge8) games at 14. At 18, I was
admitted to study Computer Engineering at [UFRJ](https://ufrj.br/en/). I've then
worked on [Orama](https://orama.com.br), [Stone](http://stone.com.br), and the
[Ethereum Foundation](http://ethereum.org). I'm currently working on the
[Kindelia](http://github.com/kindelia) project, where I've created
[Kind](https://github.com/kindelia/kind) and
[HVM](https://github.com/kindelia/hvm).
